# Dice
A python module for simulating dice rolls.
Currently only supports a 6 sided dice with a command line (the module still uses int(input()) as it's way of figuring out how many times to roll.) 
dicemodule.py is the module, dicerandom.py is the script version of the module and test(numbers).py is the test file I use for testing the module.
